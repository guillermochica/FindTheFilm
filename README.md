FindTheFilm
===========

**A program in node.js to find basic information about movies**

This program uses the OMDB API (http://www.omdbapi.com/) which is like a third party API from which IMDB movie information can be gotten to be used in applications.

**Instructions**:
Open a terminal and write `node findfilm name+of+the+film` . It is important to separate the words of the name with "+" instead of with blank spaces.
Additionally, if you want a longer version of the plot, you can write `full` after the name of the movie.
